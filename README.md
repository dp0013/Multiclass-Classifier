# Multiclass Classifier
 This is a Neural Net model using Octave to recognize handwritten numbers, based on the Coursera MAchine Learning course.
 
 ===== DESCRIPTION ===== 

These are OCTAVE files (i.e., similar to MATLAB), largely based on matrix operations implementing logistic regression and neural network algorithms to predict which handwritten number is being displayed.  The hand-written digits are provided in a sample set of 5000 20 x 20 grayscale pixel images, thus the total size of the data (sample) set (X) is 5000 x 400, with each value representing a brightness for that particular pixel.
 
The program then uses forward propogation through 3 layers (one input, one hidden, and one output) to predict which number is being displayed with a 97.5% accuracy.
 
 
===== HOW TO USE =====

To implement the classifier, type (without quotes) "ex3_nn" in the Octave Command-Line Interface (CLI).  The program will generate each digit individually in a separate window (Figure 1) and will display the corresponding predicted classification (value) in the CLI.  Press 'enter' to try a new one or 'q' to quit.

This project was based on the last part of week 4 of Coursera's Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng.  Enjoy!
